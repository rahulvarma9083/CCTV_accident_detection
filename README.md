# Accident & Incident Detection System ðŸš¨

This project is an AI-powered real-time surveillance system that uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection to identify critical incidents such as **fire, accidents, fighting, and weapons** from live CCTV footage. Once an incident is detected with high confidence, the system automatically sends an **email alert** (with attached frame evidence) to the appropriate authority such as the **fire station, police station, or hospital**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Real-time Detection:** Detects fire, accidents, fighting, and weapons using YOLO from live video streams.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends email notifications with attached incident images to relevant authorities.
- **Customizable Notification System:**
  - Fire â†’ Fire Station & Police Station  
  - Accident â†’ Hospital & Police Station  
  - Fighting/Weapon â†’ Police Station
- **Incident Management:** Limits repeated email alerts to avoid spamming while ensuring critical alerts are sent.
- **Easy Integration:** Works with CCTV cameras or webcam streams.

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- **Python** â€“ core programming language  
- **YOLO (Ultralytics)** â€“ real-time object detection  
- **OpenCV** â€“ video capture and frame processing  
- **smtplib + MIME (Python Email Library)** â€“ sending email alerts with images  
- **Math & Keyboard libraries** â€“ confidence thresholding and user control  

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases
- Campus surveillance (schools, colleges, universities)  
- Public safety monitoring (roads, public areas, offices)  
- Smart city security solutions  
- Industrial safety monitoring
